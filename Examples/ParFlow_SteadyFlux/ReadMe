This is a test simulation to create a steadystate on a hillsope and then
do a trasient EcoSLIM simulation

1. Copy this directory from the github repository to where you want to work

2. Run the spinup tcl script
tclsh steadyflux_hillslope2D_spinup.tcl

 - this should create the directory 'spinup0.00125' that should
 have 20 time steps output

 3. Run the transient tcl script
tclsh steadyflux_hillslope2D_transient

 - This should create the directory 'transient0.00125'
 - It will copy the last time step from the spinup run in and use this as the IC
 - This should have 3000 time steps outputs
 - When the run finishes it will create the 'EcoSLIM0.00125' folder and
 copy the EcoSLIM input in

 4. Run EcoSLIM
 cd EcoSLIM and run EcoSLIM from where

 - This should give you 3000 timesteps of vtk outputs as well as the gridded
 text outputs for R SLIM_flux_test_ET_summary.#####.txt

 5. Run the R analysis script.
 'Evaluate_Test.R'
 - Note that this is purely exploratory at this point and isn't setup to save outputs
 or anything so you should open it and run in pieces
 - also the working directory will need to be changed at the top.
