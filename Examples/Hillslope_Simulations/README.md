This directory contain hillslope simulation examples that demonstrate EcoSLIM

** Paper Cases : these are the cases from [Maxwell et al Ecohydrology](https://doi.org/10.1002/eco.2042)

 These cases run in two parts, first the ParFlow tcl script, then the EcoSLIM run.  They correspond to the *LW* and *ER* forcing and the *Shrub* and *Trees* cases.
