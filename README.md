EcoSLIM
=======

**EcoSLIM** private repo for development.  Will be public repo under /ParFlow when published


**EcoSLIM** is a Lagrangian, particle-tracking that simulates advective and diffusive movement of water parcels.  This code can be used to simulate age, diagnosing travel times, source water composition and flowpaths.  It integrates seamlessly with **ParFlow-CLM**.
