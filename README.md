# EcoSLIM
EcoSLIM private repo for development.  Will be public repo under /ParFlow when published


 SLIM2 is a Lagrangian, particle-tracking model for simulating subsurface and surface transport of reactive (such as microbial agents and metals) and non-reactive contaminants, diagnosing travel times, paths etc., which integrates seamlessly with ParFlow.
